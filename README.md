# bookvibe-3.2

Backend Start-Up (By Allana),
this is what I have installed:

1. npm init -y
2. npm install express
3. npm install nodemon - You shouldnt have to install this as I have added this into the package.json file as a dev so you can just run npm run dev
4. npm install dotenv - this will hide each of our ports and mongodb clusters
5. npm install mongoose


For Frontend Start-Up we will want:
1. npx create-react-app
2. npm install sass
